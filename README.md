# Micromaster Website Discounts Results Parser

This repository contains a Python script designed to efficiently extract discounts data from JSON files generated by the Micromaster website. The script organizes these JSON results into a neatly formatted Excel spreadsheet.

## Features

- **JSON Parsing**: This Python script is adept at interpreting and reading JSON files containing installment data.
- **Data Manipulation**: Capabilities include renaming columns, deleting specified columns, translating specific cell values, and more.
- **Excel Exportation**: The processed data is exported into an Excel file, with cell formatting applied for clearer representation.
- **Automation**: The entire process from reading JSON to producing a formatted Excel file is automated, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

## Code Walkthrough

Here is a section-by-section walkthrough of the script:

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: The script starts by importing essential libraries such as `pandas` for data handling, `json` for reading JSON files, and `openpyxl` for managing Excel-specific features.

\```python
import pandas as pd
import json
import openpyxl
from openpyxl.styles import Alignment, Font, PatternFill
from openpyxl.utils import get_column_letter
\```

2. **Reading and Parsing the JSON Data**: The script reads the JSON file into a Python dictionary and then normalizes it into a DataFrame.

\```python
with open('Installments.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    data = json.load(file)

df_main = pd.json_normalize(data)
\```

3. **Data Processing**: Based on the requirements, various operations like renaming columns, deleting unwanted columns, and transforming specific cell values are performed.

\```python
column_renaming = {...}
df_main.rename(columns=column_renaming, inplace=True)

columns_to_drop = [...]
df_main = df_main.drop(columns=[col for col in columns_to_drop if col in df_main.columns])

messenger_mapping = {...}
df_main['Internal Messenger Type'] = df_main['Internal Messenger Type'].replace(messenger_mapping)
\```

4. **Data Export and Excel Formatting**: The processed DataFrame is then exported to an Excel file. Post-export, cell formatting, including font style, cell color, and cell alignment, is applied to the resulting Excel sheet.

\```python
output_file = 'output.xlsx'
with pd.ExcelWriter(output_file, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    df_main.to_excel(writer, sheet_name='Main', index=False)

wb = openpyxl.load_workbook(output_file)
...
wb.save(output_file)
\```

## Usage

To run this script:

1. Ensure the JSON file (`Installments.json`) is present in the same directory as the script.
2. Ensure that the libraries `json`, `pandas`, and `openpyxl` are installed in your Python environment.
3. Simply execute the script with a Python interpreter.

Please note that the script expects the JSON file to follow a specific structure related to installment data. If your data is differently structured, modifications to the script may be required.
